color clock

I was thinking of light art that that changes almost imperceptibly, and was
playing with color gradients. This is a natural step after urban bloom:

Color clock is a wash of a single color at any point slowly changing throughout the day. If you
stare at it you won't see it change. If you come back after an hour or two,
you'll notice.  I wanted it to be blue at midnight. It is based on your local
time. It cycles every 24 hours.
